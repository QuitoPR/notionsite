## Level Design


I was the primary designer for all five levels featured in the demo and many more in the project. The levels were developed prototype to finish in-engine which allowed for fast iteration in response to internal and external feedback. 


![Levels were created from basic shapes. Concept to finish all in-engine.](https://notion-hugo.pages.dev/api?block_id=cd2673d3-231c-4a93-ae2f-450f1cd82ff9)


![For notes and iteration, a level screenshot was generated.](https://notion-hugo.pages.dev/api?block_id=7237cee1-e652-44fa-9fac-57ed570d1e8c)


![Playtest review notes were made on level image as reference for next design pass.](https://notion-hugo.pages.dev/api?block_id=4fab9f20-c4ef-4e8c-84d4-74f7e4c73d8d)

	**Level Dressing **


	The levels were blocked out with basic collision boxes which I was then responsible for dressing with 3D models as they were delivered by the art team.


## Flow Pass


Iterative process that analyzes level designs for potential stop-points. We measured common jump arcs and distances then ensured level obstacles did not interrupt player movement often. This worked well to increased the fuzziness of precision requirements. Using these measurements as templates when creating new levels led to spending less time making smaller level tweaks.

This is the playable demo from the [Prisma Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shinyboltgames/prisma-and-the-masquerade-menace) from early 2017.


It features the first five levels of the game along with Hub world that links the levels together.


I initially came onto the project after it's first 2D prototype where the core mechanics of platforming and dimension swapping/switching were already present. We started to develop the idea further for a small single class project with 3D but keeping 2D gameplay. This is where we introduced the idea of each dimension granting powers. The following year we took it even further as part of our Senior thesis project. This iteration of the project is what we ultimately decided to take into the market as an independent company. This demo is the latest publicly available example of my work on the game before I had to leave the company in 2017.

My main responsibilities featured in this example:


## Game Mechanics


Concepted and developed secondary game mechanic ideas featured in this demo and throughout the game such as breakable objects, crumbling platforms, enemies and enemy behaviors.


	**Design Tuning**


	Tuned the existing mechanics with values exposed as requested to engineers to improve the user experience. 


## Level Design


I was the primary designer for all five levels featured in the demo and many more in the project. The levels were developed prototype to finish in-engine which allowed for fast iteration in response to internal and external feedback. 


	**Level Dressing **


	The levels were blocked out with basic collision boxes which I was then responsible for dressing with 3D models as they were delivered by the art team.


## QA


I was the sole tester on the project responsible for reporting any issues found with the game. In cases involving level issues, it was also my responsibility to fix them. I was also responsible for ensuring the game worked as expected in its final executable package.


## UX/UI


While not featured prominently in this demo, I was also responsible for designing and prototyping the look and feel of the interface which I've highlighted on this page:  [UI System Design for Prisma]({{% relref "UI-System-Design-for-Prisma-32a217f5e7404fa0a44ad7f0d69612fa.md" %}})
